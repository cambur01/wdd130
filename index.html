            <p>Hello! My name is Cameron. I grew up in the state of Utah, and living in the mountains has led me to love the outdoors, from hiking, to fishing, to mountain biking. I love music, and my main instrument is the guitar. For work I am a sales rep selling solar on the east coast, and I love my job with a passion. That's a little bit about me, welcome to my website!</p>
